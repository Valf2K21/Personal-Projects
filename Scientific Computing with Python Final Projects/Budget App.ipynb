    "Task:\n",
    "1. create a category class with a list-type instance variable called ledger that will instantiate objects based on different categories like food, clothing, auto, and entertainment, and must contain the methods listed below:\n",
    "    - a deposit method that accepts an amount and description and appends it to the ledger list in the form of {'amount' : amount, 'description' : description}; if no description is given, default it to an empty string\n",
    "    - a withdraw method that is similar to the deposit method and will either return True or False whether the withdrawal took place or not, but the amount passed in should be stored in the ledger as a negative number; if not enough funds, nothing should be added to the ledger\n",
    "    - a get_balance method that returns the current balance of the budget category based on the deposits and withdrawals that have occurred\n",
    "    - a transfer method that accepts an amount and another budget category as arguments, which will add a withdraw amount and the description 'Transfer to [destination budget category]', while it also adds a deposit amount and the description 'Transfer from [source budget category]'; if not enough funds, nothing should be added to either ledgers and will return either True or False whether the transfer took place or not\n",
    "    - a check_funds method that accepts an amount as an argument, which will return False if the amount is greater than the balance of the budget category and returns True otherwise; this method should be used by both the withdraw and transfer methods\n",
    "2. when the budget object is called, it should display the following:\n",
    "    - a title line of 30 characters where the name of the category is centered in a line of * characters\n",
    "    - a list of items in the ledger, showing the description and amount; the first 23 characters of the description should be displayed, then the amount and the latter must be right aligned, containing two decimal places, and display a maximum of 7 characters\n",
    "    - a line displaying the category total\n",
    "3. create a function called create_spend_chart, which is separate from the category class, that takes a list of categories as an argument and return a string that is a bar chart, which have the following characteristics:\n",
    "    - the percentage spent should be calculated only with withdrawals and not with deposits\n",
    "    - the left side of the chart (y-axis) should be labels 0-100\n",
    "    - the 'bars' in the bar chart should be made out of the 'o' character\n",
    "    - the height of each bar should be rounded down to the nearest 10\n",
    "    - the horirzontal line (x-axis) should go two spaces past the final bar (0)\n",
    "    - each category should be written vertically below the bar (x-axis)\n",
    "    - there should be a title at the top that says 'Percentage spent by category'\n",
    "  h. this function shall handle up to four categories"
