    "Task:\n",
    "1. create a Hat class that will take a variable number of arguments specifying the number of balls of each color in the hat; a hat must have at least one ball in it\n",
    "    - class object creation sample: hat1 = Hat(red = 2, blue = 1, yellow = 2)\n",
    "2. convert the arguments passed into the hat object to a contents variable, which will multiply the number of string color names depending on the number of assigned balls of such color\n",
    "    - contents instance variable sample of class object creation sample above: contents = ['red', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'yellow']\n",
    "3. a draw method, that accepts an argument indicating the number of balls to draw from the hat, must be in the Hat class; it must remove balls from the contents variable at random and then return the list of drawn balls as a list of strings\n",
    "    - note that balls drawn must not be returned in the hat during the draw; all unique balls must only be drawn once\n",
    "    - if the number of balls to draw is greater than the balls available in the hat, return all the balls\n",
    "4. create an experiment function in prob_calculator.py (not inside the Hat class) which will accept the following arguments:\n",
    "    - hat - a hat object containing balls that should be copied inside the function\n",
    "    - expected_balls - an object indicating the exact group of balls to attempt to draw from the hat for the experiment (ex: user expects to draw 1 blue ball and 1 red ball)\n",
    "    - num_balls_drawn - number of balls to draw out of the hat in each experiment\n",
    "    - num_experiments - number of experiments to perform (more experiments = more accuracy of the approximate probability)\n",
    "5. the experiment function must return a probability\n",
    "    - for example, if you want to determine the probability of getting at least 1 blue ball and 1 red ball when you draw 3 balls from a hat containing 2 red balls, 1 blue ball, and 2 yellow balls, perform N experiments, count M times you get at least 1 blue ball and 1 red ball, then divide M/N to get the estimated probability\n",
    "    - experiment function call sample from above scenario (part 1): hat = Hat(red = 2, blue = 1, yellow = 2)\n",
    "    - experiment function call sample from above scenario (part 2): probability = experiment(hat = hat, expected_balls = {'blue':1, 'red':1}, num_balls_drawn = 3, num_experiments = 2000)\n",
    "    - note that the probability will be slightly different each time the code is run\n",
    "    - consider importing and using the modules 'copy' and 'random'\n",
    "    \n",
    "To-Do Tomro:\n",
    "1. create experiment function\n",
    "2. make sure that experiment function returns a probability\n",
    "3. replace dev-defined inputs into user-defined inputs"
