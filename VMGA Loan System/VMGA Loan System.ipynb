    "### TKinter Project No. 1: VMGA Loan System\n",
    "Developer: Galinato, Valfrid G.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start Date: Oct. 5, 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "End Date: Oct. 27, 2022 (v1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "Develop an application that can do the following:\n",
    "- connect to a database that can store information\n",
    "- has a simple yet efficient graphics user interface (GUI) that is useful for user interaction\n",
    "- is portable and can be used on any Windows devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of the application are:\n",
    "- a subpanel containing labels and entries (of each detail below), and button (add personal record to database) widgets that is useful to add personal record that will store the following in the tables of the database:\n",
    "    - debtor's details table:\n",
    "        - name\n",
    "        - age\n",
    "        - sex\n",
    "        - address\n",
    "        - contact no.\n",
    "- another subpanel containing labels and entries (of each detail below), and button (add transaction to database) widgets that is useful to add transaction that will store the following in the tables of the database:\n",
    "    - debt's details table:\n",
    "        - debt date\n",
    "        - loaned amount\n",
    "        - interest amount\n",
    "        - total amount (automated calculation; formula = loaned amount + interest amount)\n",
    "    - payment's details table:\n",
    "        - payment date\n",
    "        - amount paid\n",
    "        - balance amount (automated calculation; formula = total amount - amount paid)\n",
    "- a subpanel containing labels and entries (of debtor's name detail), and button (edit selected existing debtor's personal record OR remove selected debtor's personal record and their debts) widgets that is useful to either:\n",
    "    - edit an existing personal record in the selected debtor's details table by looking up the debtor's name; OR\n",
    "        - note: there must be no option to edit debt's details for security reasons\n",
    "    - remove the selected debtor's details, including their debt history\n",
    "- another subpanel containing labels and entries (of debtor's name detail), and button (view all debtors' details OR view all debt history OR view all payment history) widgets that is useful to either:\n",
    "    - show a list of debtors and their details in a tabular screen in the interface; OR\n",
    "    - show all debt history of all debtors\n",
    "        - note: this option must have sort options (sort by alphabetical name OR gender OR debt date OR balance amount\n",
    "    - show all payment history of all debtors\n",
    "        - note: this option must have sort options (sort by alphabetical name OR gender OR payment date OR balance amount\n",
    "- a subpanel that will serve as the display screen of any sort of data that the user wants to see (list of debtors and their details OR view all debt history OR view all payment history)"
